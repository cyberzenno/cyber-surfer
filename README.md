# Cyber Surfer

This is a test I've done some time ago. The target was to create an application, that searches and presents some Bing results by scraping the pages.
The test was also asking to add a small analysis functionality that counts the most common words and a button to download the CVS file for the results.

I really liked the idea and I tried to make it extensible for adding also other search engines. Then I thought about a fancy name and here it is **Cyber Surfer**.
